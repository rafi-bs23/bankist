In this project that allows users to sign in to their accounts, transfer money to other users, 
request a loan, and close their account. Users can view their current balance, transaction history with dates, 
incoming and outgoing balances, and interest rates that they calculate themselves. The system logs out users if they remain inactive for a set time interval.
